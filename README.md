# MapsApp
created a maps app that displays stations on a bus route


This app is demo in which i buit two screens   
first to search between the routes within the list of available routes.  
second screen shows map of all the staions on that route (if GPS is on then when you reach a station it will ask the user that whether its his stop or not)



Here are some screenshots
